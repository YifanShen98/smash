/**
 * @brief A container to keep track of all ever existed input keys.

 * @remark Each input key exists as static constant member and a reference to it
 *         is stored in the InputKeys::list container. Therefore, the following
 *         steps are needed in order to add a new key.
 *         -# Add a new member being consistent with the existing notation.
 *            Use \c _ to separate YAML sections in the variable name and use
 *            a name that reflects sections. A double underscore in C++ is
 *            reserved and should not be used in identifiers; hence it must not
 *            be used to separate sections. If any label consists of more than
 *            one word, use lowerCamelCase convention, although this violates
 *            the general codebase rules (it adds readability in this case).
 *            Abbreviations are allowed, but be consistent if any already
 *            exists.
 *         -# If the newly introduced key has a new type w.r.t. all existing
 *            keys, you need to add it to the key_references_variant alias. In
 *            particular, you need to add a type to the \c std::variant which
 *            will be <tt>std::reference_wrapper<const Key<NEW_TYPE>></tt> with
 *            \c NEW_TYPE replaced by the type of your new key.
 *         -# Add a reference to the newly introduced variable to the
 *            InputKeys::list container. This must be done using \c std::cref as
 *            for the other references. Respecting the members order is welcome.
 *
 * @attention If you need to deprecate or to mark a key as not valid anymore,
 *            add the corresponding SMASH version to the \c Key member
 *            constructor invocation. <b>Do not remove a member if that key
 *            is not valid any more!</b> It is intended to track here keys
 *            that were existing in the past and are not accepted anymore.
 *            Instead, after having added the version in which the key
 *            has been deprecated or removed, <b>adjust the user documentation
 *            by marking the key as deprecated or by removing the key and
 *            its description</b>.
