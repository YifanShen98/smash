 * \key Delta_Time (double, optional, default: 1.0): \n
 * Fixed time step at which the collision-finding grid is recreated, and, if
 * potentials are on, momenta are updated according to the equations of motion.
 * The collision-finding grid finds all the collisions from time
 * t_{beginning_of_timestep} until time t_{beginning_of_timestep} + Delta_Time,
 * and puts them into a vector. The collisions are then sorted in order of
 * occurrence, and particles are propagated from collision to collision. After
 * each performed collision, additional collisions are found for outgoing
 * particles and merged into the sorted vector.
 *
 * If potentials are on, the Delta_Time should be small enough, typically
 * around 0.1 fm/c. However, if potentials are off, it can be arbitrarily
 * large. In this case it only influences the runtime, but not physics.
 * If Time_Step_Mode = None is chosen, then the user-provided value of
 * Delta_Time is ignored and Delta_Time is set to the End_Time.
 *
 * \key Ensembles (int, optional, default = 1): \n
 * Number of parallel ensembles in the simulation.
 *
 * An ensemble is an instance of the system, and without mean-field potentials
 * it is practically equivalent to a completely separate and uncorrelated event.
 * Each ensemble is an independent simulation: initialization, collisions,
 * decays, box wall crossings, and propagation of particles is performed
 * independently within each ensemble.
 *
 * However, the densities and mean-field potentials are computed as averages
 * over all ensembles (within a given event). This process can be also viewed as
 * calculating densities and mean-fields by summing over particles in all
 * ensembles combined, where each particle carries a fraction 1/n_ensembles of
 * its "real" charge. Such technique is called *parallel ensemble* technique. It
 * increases statistics necessary for precise density calculation without
 * increasing the number of collisions, which is not the case in the *full
 * ensemble* method (see below). Because of this, the parallel ensembles
 * technique is computationally faster than the full ensemble technique.
 *
 * \key Testparticles (int, optional, default = 1): \n
 * Number of test-particles per real particle in the simulation.
 *
 * Amount of initial sampled particles is increased by this factor,
 * while all cross sections are decreased by this factor. In this
 * way mean free path does not change. Larger number of testparticles
 * helps to reduce spurious effects of geometric collision criterion
 * (see \iref{Cheng:2001dz}). It also reduces correlations related
 * to collisions and decays (but not the ones related to mean fields),
 * therefore the larger the number of testparticles, the closer the results
 * of the simulations should be to the solution of Boltzmann equation.
 * These advantages come at a cost of computational time.
 *
 * Testparticles are a way to increase statistics necessary for
 * precise density calculation, which is why they are needed for mean field
 * potentials. The technique of using testparticles for mean field
 * is called *full ensemble* technique. The number of collisions (and
 * consequently the simulation time) scales as square of the number of
 * testparticles, and that is why full ensemble is slower than parallel
 * ensemble.
 *
 * \key Derivatives_Mode (string, optional, default = "Covariant Gaussian"): \n
 * The mode of calculating the gradients, for example gradients of baryon
 * current. Currently SMASH supports two derivatives modes: "Covariant Gaussian"
 * and "Finite difference". Covariant Gaussian derivatives can be used when
 * Covariant Gaussian smearing is used; they are Lorentz covariant, but they do
 * not calculate the time derivative of the current properly. The "Finite
 * difference" mode requires using the lattice, and the derivatives are
 * calculated based on finite differences of a given quantity at adjacent
 * lattice nodes; this mode is more numerically efficient.

 * \key Rest_Frame_Density_Derivatives_Mode (string, optional, default = "Off"):
 * \n
 * The mode of calculating the gradients of currents, decides whether the rest
 * frame density derivatives are copmuted (these derivatives are needed for the
 * VDF potentials, but not for the Skyrme potentials).
 *
 * \key Smearing_Mode (string, optional, default = "Covariant Gaussian"): \n
 * The mode of smearing for density calculation.
 *
 * Smearing is necessary to ensure a smooth gradient calculation, and it can be
 * thought of as smoothing out charge density fluctuations due to the finite
 * number of test-particles used. In general, this is done by distributing the
 * contribution to charge density from a given particle according to some
 * prescription. For example, in Gaussian smearing the charge density of a
 * particle is given by a Gaussian with some chosen width, centered at the
 * position of the particle; the Gaussian is normalized such that integrating
 * over the entire space yields the charge of the particle. In result, the
 * particle's charge is "smeared" over the space around it. Note that the case
 * with no smearing is recovered when the charge contribution from each particle
 * is taken to be a Dirac delta function centered at the position of the
 * particle.
 *
 * Currently, SMASH supports three smearing modes:
 * 1) "Covariant Gaussian": This smearing represents the charge density of a
 * particle as a Gaussian centered at the position of a particle; the user can
 * specify the width and the cutoff of the Gaussian (the employed Gaussians, in
 * principle non-zero over the entire available space, are "cut off" at some
 * distance r_cut from the particle to improve calculation time). This smearing
 * is Lorentz covariant which results in correct density profiles of
 * relativistic systems. The downside of the smearing is its long computation
 * time, as well as the fact that when the density is added to lattice nodes, it
 * is done so by Euler approximation (using the density value at the lattice
 * node), which does not conserve the number of particles on the lattice.
 * 2) "Triangular": This smearing requires lattice; it represents the charge
 * density of a particle in a given space direction as a "triangle" peaking at
 * the particle's position and linearly decreasing over a specified range. The
 * user specifies the range of the smearing in units of lattice spacings. This
 * smearing is relatively fast, and it does conserve the number of particles on
 * the lattice (due to the fact that the Euler integration is exact for a linear
 * function).
 * 3) "Discrete": This smearing requires lattice; the easiest of all smearing
 * modes, it adds a specified portion of the particle's charge density to a node
 * closest to the particle's position, and distributes the remainder evenly
 * among the 6 nearest neighbor nodes. The user specifies the weight given to
 * the center node; for example, if this weight is 1/3, then each of the six
 * nearest neighbor nodes gets 1/9 of the particle's charge. This smearing is
 * extremely fast, but is also rather coarse and requires using a large number
 * of test-particles to produce smooth gradients.
 *
 *
 * \key Gaussian_Sigma (double, optional, default = 1.0): \n
 * Parameter for Covariant Gaussian smearing: Width of gaussians that represent
 * Wigner density of particles, in fm.
 *
 * \key Gauss_Cutoff_In_Sigma (double, optional, default = 4.0): \n
 * Parameter for Covariant Gaussian smearing: Distance in sigma at which
 * gaussian is considered 0.
 *
 * \key Triangular_Range (double, optional, default = 2.0): \n
 * Parameter for Triangular smearing: Half of the base of a symmetric triangle
 * that represents particle density, in units of lattice spacings.
 *
 * \key Discrete_Weight (double, optional, default = 0.333333): \n
 * Parameter for Discrete smearing: Weight given to particle density at the
 * the center node; cannot be smaller than 1./7. (the boundary case of 1./7.
 * results in an even distribution of particle's density over the center node
 * and 6 neighboring nodes).

 * \page input_output_options_ Output Configuration
 *
 * Description of options
 * ---------------------
 * To produce a certain output content it is necessary to explicitly configure
 * it in the Output section of the configuration file. This means, that the
 * Output section needs to contain a subsection for the desired output.
 * Aditionally, there are general output configuration parameters. \n
 * \n
 * ### General output configuration parameters:
 * \key Output_Interval (double, optional, default = End_Time): \n
 * Defines the period of intermediate output of the status of the simulated
 * system in Standard Output and other output formats which support this
 * functionality.
 *
 * \key Output_Times (doubles, optional, no default): \n
 * Explicitly defines the the times where output is generated in the form of
 * a list. Cannot be used in combination with Output_Interval. Output times
 * outside the simulation time are ignored. The following example will produce
 * output at event start, event end and at the specified times as long as they
 * are within the simulation time.
 *\verbatim

 * \li \key "baryon" - Net baryon density
 * \li \key "baryonic isospin" - Baryonic isospin density
 * \li \key "pion" - Pion density
 * \li \key "none" - Do not calculate density, print 0.0
 *
 * \n
 * ### Format configuration independently of the specific output content
 * Further options are defined for every single output content
 * (see \ref output_contents_ "output contents" for the list of
 * possible contents). Independently of the content, it is always necessary
 * to provide the format in which the output should be generated.
 *
 * \key Format (list of formats, optional, default = [ ]):\n
 * List of formats for writing particular content.
 * Possible formats for every content are listed and described in
 * \ref output_contents_ "output contents". List of available formats is
 * \ref list_of_output_formats "here".

 *
 *   \key Quantities (list of thermodynamic quantities, optional, default = [

 *   List of thermodynamic quantities that are printed to the output. Possible
 *   quantities are:
 *   \li \key "rho_eckart" - Eckart rest frame density
 *   \li \key "tmn" - Energy-momentum tensor \f$T^{\mu\nu}(t,x,y,z) \f$
 *   \li \key "tmn_landau" - Energy-momentum tensor in the Landau rest frame.
 *      This tensor is computed by boosting \f$T^{\mu\nu}(t,x,y,z) \f$
 *      to the local rest frame, where \f$T^{0i} \f$ = 0.
 *   \li \key "landau_velocity" - Velocity of the Landau rest frame.
 *      The velocity is obtained from the energy-momentum tensor
 *      \f$T^{\mu\nu}(t,x,y,z) \f$ by solving the generalized eigenvalue
 *      equation \f$(T^{\mu\nu} - \lambda g^{\mu\nu})u_{\mu}=0 \f$.
 *   \li \key "j_QBS" - Electric (Q), baryonic (B) and strange (S) currents
 *      \f$j^{\mu}_{QBS}(t,x,y,z) \f$; note that all currents are given in
 *      units of "number of charges"; multiply the electric current by the
 *      elementary charge \f$\sqrt{4 \pi \alpha_{EM}} \f$ for charge units.
 *
 *   \key Position (list of 3 doubles, optional, default = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]): \n
 *   Point, at which thermodynamic quantities are computed.
 *
 *   \key Smearing (bool, optional, default = true): \n
 *   Using Gaussian smearing for computing thermodynamic quantities or not.
 *   This triggers whether thermodynamic quantities are evaluated at a fixed
 *   point (\key true) or summed over all particles (\key false).
 *   \li \key true - smearing applied
 *   \li \key false - smearing not applied
 *
 *   The contribution to the energy-momentum tensor and current (be it electric,
 *   baryonic or strange) from a single particle in its rest frame is:
 *   \f[\begin{eqnarray} j^{\mu} = B \frac{p_0^{\mu}}{p_0^0} W \\
 *   T^{\mu \nu} = \frac{p_0^{\mu}p_0^{\nu}}{p_0^0} W \end{eqnarray}\f]
 *   with B being the charge of interest and W being the weight given to this
 *   particle. Normally, if one computes thermodynamic quantities at a point,
 *   smearing should be applied, and then W takes on the following shape:
 *   \f[W = (2 \pi \sigma^2)^{-3/2} exp \left(- \frac{(\mathbf{r}
 *   - \mathbf{r_0(t)})^2}{2\sigma^2} \right)\f]
 *   It can however be useful to compute the thermo-
 *   dynamic quantities of all particles in a box with W = 1, which
 *   would correspond to \key "Smearing: false". Note that using this option
 *   changes the units of the thermodynamic quantities, as they are no longer

 *   When using Potentials this option must be either left unset or set to
